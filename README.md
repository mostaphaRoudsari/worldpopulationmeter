worldpopulationmeter
====================

(http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/worldpopulationmeter/) is an idea that I wanted to give it a try for more than a year now, after I saw a web post with the same statement. I'm pretty sure you have seen similar statements too. They start with "out of 7 billion people in the world" and then add another statemnet; so in that sense the idea is not new.

The only change that I made was using a real-time estimation for world population so the number is closer to reality and the message looks more like what you would expect to see in 2014-2015!

So many thanks to http://www.javascriptkit.com for their source code to estimate world population, and all the online available resources for web development!

I hope you like it and happy to 2015!
