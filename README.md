worldpopulationmeter
====================

(http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/worldpopulationmeter/) is a sketch that I wanted to try for more than a year now. The statement is borrowed from an image that I saw online.

I loved the concept so much and I loved that they didn't round the number to 7 billion. Still it was disappointing that the population wasn't changing live.

So here it is! This is the data driven version of the same image! I like how it looks like a heart and change of the number reminds me of heart beats or maybe I'm the only one who think it looks like that!

So many thanks to http://www.javascriptkit.com for their source code to estimate world population, and all the online available resources for web development!
